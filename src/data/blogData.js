This disconnect, often called the "know-do gap," is particularly pronounced in developing regions where resources are limited and systems are fragile.' },

            { type: 'paragraph', content: 'Implementation research is the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of evidence-based interventions into practice and policy. Rather than focusing on developing new health interventions, implementation research examines how existing interventions can be successfully integrated into specific contexts.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: 'This field acknowledges that effective interventions often fail to achieve their potential impact when implemented in real-world settings. The approach is inherently practical, focusing on identifying and addressing barriers to implementation while leveraging facilitators that can enhance adoption and scale-up.' },

Consider maternal health interventions: we have evidence-based practices that can significantly reduce maternal mortality, yet these interventions often fail to reach those who need them most.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: 'Implementation research helps us understand why effective interventions don\'t always translate to real-world impact. Is it because of supply chain issues, provider knowledge gaps, community acceptance, or policy barriers? By identifying these specific challenges, targeted solutions can be developed.' },
            { type: 'paragraph', content: 'Perhaps most importantly, implementation research shifts the focus from simply generating evidence to actively promoting its use. This approach recognizes that knowledge alone is insufficient; we need systematic strategies to ensure knowledge is applied effectively in practice.' },
